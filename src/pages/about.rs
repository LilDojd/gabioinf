                I currently work full-time as a software engineer at [InSilico Medicine](https://insilico.com/). 
                We do some cool drug design-related stuff that involves a lot of AI. I am particularly proud
                of my contribution to the development of [INS018_055](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1048870) for the
